He was a perfect fit for our small agile team, picked everything up very quickly and was excellent at not just building what we asked for but through discussion helping us realise how to do it better. Very sad to see him go once his contract was up but hopefully we'll be able to get him back soon! I'd recommend him without hesitation.</blockquote>
